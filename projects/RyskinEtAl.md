# Ryskin, Kurumada, & Brown-Schmidt 2019
## Scalar Adjectives and the Linking Hypothesis
Ryskin, Kurumada, and Brown-Schmidt explored the processing of scalar adjectives by manipulating whether an adjective was heard in the utterance (click on the (*big*) pickle), whether the target object was presented in an contrastive set (big pickle vs. big and small pickle), and whether the utterances were pragmatically "reliable" (the presence of an adjective and the presence of a contrast set co-occur) or "unreliable" (presence of an adjective and presence of a contrast set do not co-occur).

We are currently in the processes of replicating their experiment 2 as an incremental decision and production task. Stay tuned for the final results!
