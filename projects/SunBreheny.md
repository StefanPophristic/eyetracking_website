# Sun and Breheny 2020
## Quantifiers and the Linking Hypothesis
In their original study, [Sun and Breheny (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2019.1678759) looked at the effect that target referent set size and presence of same-type residue objects have on the processing of the quantifiers "some", "all", and numbers as measured through processing speed and location of eye gaze. We replicate their study 3 as an incremental decision task and a production task with and without a training stage, and find that the extent to which the Referential Belief Link holds for the quantifier processing dataset of Sun and Breheny (2020) was modulated by participants' likely quantifier production expectations.
