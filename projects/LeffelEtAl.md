## Leffel, Xiang, & Kennedy 2016
# Gradable + Absolute Adjectives and the Linking hypothesis
[Leffel et al. (2016)]() looked at the processesing of relative and absolute gradable adjectives within varying contexts. They looked at the effect that the presence/absence of a contrast set and the type of adjective (gradable vs. asbolute) had on location of eye-gaze. We replicate their eye-tracking study as an incremental decisions and production task.
