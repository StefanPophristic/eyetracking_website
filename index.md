# The Linking Hypothesis and Visual World Paradigm

The Linking Hypothesis is a collaborative project that aims to assess and make explicit the link between eye-movements, linguistic input, and cognitive processes in visual world paradigm (VWP) studiesâ€”a method widely used in psycholinguistics.

We believe that the linking hypothesis for such eye-tracking data must account for **exploitation** and **exploration** of the visual scene. That is, **exploiting** visual cues to understand an intended target of an utterance and **exploring** the visual space given unexpected linguistic input.

# Our Projects

Our projects are incremental-decision task and free production task replications of various eye-tracking studies. Each is grouped under the name of the original eye-tracking study which it replicates.

[Learn more](/learnMore/index.html) about these tasks and how they are used to assess the linking hypothesis.
