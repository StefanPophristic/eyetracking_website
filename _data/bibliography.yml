  title: The role of production expectations in visual world paradigm linking hypotheses
  abstract: "While widely used in psycholinguistics, the linking hypothesis for eye movements in the visual world paradigm is still poorly understood. Recent work on linking hypotheses for referential tasks in particular has found mixed support for the Referential Belief Link: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the intended target in that time window. Here we test the hypothesis that participants’ expectations for the utterances observed in an experiment modulate the extent to which the Referential Belief Link holds. This hypothesis is motivated by a simple idea: when utterances are unexpected, listeners engage in additional reasoning to make sense of the observed signal. In a re-analysis of a previous eye movement and incremental decision task dataset, in conjunction with two novel production experiments, we find that the more surprising an observed utterance is, the smaller the correlation between explicit and implicit beliefs is. We discuss the importance of participants’ production expectations in research using the visual world paradigm."

  title: "Seeing is believing: testing an explicit linking assumption for visual world eye-tracking in psycholinguistics"
  abstract: "Experimental investigation is fundamental to theory-building in cognitive science, but its value depends on the linking as- sumptions made by researchers about the mapping between empirical measurements and theoretical constructs. We ar- gue that sufficient clarity and justification are often lacking for linking assumptions made in visual world eye-tracking, a widely used experimental method in psycholinguistic research. We test what we term the Referential Belief linking assump- tion: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the in- tended target in that time window. We do so by comparing eye-tracking data against explicit beliefs collected in an incre- mental decision task (Exp. 1), which replicates a scalar impli- cature processing study (Exp. 3 of Sun & Breheny, 2020). In Exp. 2, we replicate Sun and Breheny (2020) in a web-based eye-tracking paradigm using WebGazer.js. The results pro- vide support for the Referential Belief link and cautious opti- mism for the prospect of conducting web-based eye-tracking. We discuss limitations on both fronts."

  title: What do eye movements in the visual world reflect? A case study from adjectives
  abstract: "A common dependent measure used in visual-world eye-tracking experiments is the proportion of looks to a visually depicted object in a certain time window after the onset of the critical stimulus. When interpreting such data, a common assumption is that looks to the object reflect the listener’s belief that the object is the intended target referent. While this is intuitively plausible (at least for paradigms in which the task requires selecting a referent), relatively little is known about how exactly the proportion of looks to an object is related to a listener’s current belief about that object. Here, we test a simple, explicit linking hypothesis: the proportion of looks to an object reflects the probability that the listener assigns to the object being the target. To test this hypothesis, we supplement the eye-tracking data from Leffel, Xiang, and Kennedy (2016) with an offline incremental decision task to measure participants’ beliefs about the intended referent at various points in the unfolding sentence, and assess the extent to which these beliefs predict the eye-tracking data. The results suggest that the degree to which an object is believed to be the referent is only one factor that affects eye movements in referential tasks. Preliminary free production data we have collected for the scenes suggests that utterance expectations also play a role. We discuss methodological implications of these results for experimental linguistics."
