<p>The visual world paradigm (VWP) is a widely used methodology in psycholinguistics, whereby participantsâ€™ eye movements are tracked as they hear linguistic input. Since it has been shown eye-movements are sensitive to linguistic input, researchers use the VWP to create a fine-grained record of participantsâ€™ language-directed attention given linguistic input.</p>

<p>However, the <em>linking hypothesis</em>â€“the link between eye-movements, linguistic input, and cognitive processesâ€“for the VWP is still poorly understood. One explicit proposal, for active referential tasks (in which a participant must identify and select a speakerâ€™s intended referent) is:</p>

\[p_{emirical}(r | u) \propto	p_{belief}(r = target | u)\]

<p>That is, the proportion of looks (\(p_{empirical}\)) to an object <em>r</em> in response to a speakerâ€™s utterance (<em>u</em>) reflects the participantâ€™s degree of belief (\(p_{belief}\)) that <em>r</em> is the referent that the speaker intended.</p>

<p>However, assessment of this linking hypothesis has given mixed results (). We believe that this is because this linking function only accounts for <em>exploitation</em> and not <em>exploration</em>. That is, the linking function explains where participants may look, if they are familiar with the objects presented in the VWP and the way in which the target object is referred to. However, if the linguistic input or visually presented images are unexpected, participants may want to <em>explore</em> their visual space in order to establish 1) what a speaker may refer to the images as, and 2) why a speaker may have chosen an unexpected way to refer to the images.</p>

<p>For example, FIND A GOOD INTUITIVE EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>In order to assess the explicit linking function, we re-implement active-refential-task eye-tracking experiments as an incremental decision study. The incremental decision study gives us a direct measure of participantsâ€™ explicit belief that an object is the speakerâ€™s intended target. We can thus compare eye-movements (\(p_{emirical}\)) with participantsâ€™ explicit belief (\(p_{belief}\)).</p>

<p>In order to assess the role of <em>exploration</em> due to unexpected linguistic input, we re-implement the eye-tracking study and incremental decision study as a production study. Through participant produced utterances, we can calculate the surprisal (and thus the effect) of the linguistic input used in the eye-tracking and incremental decision study.</p>
