<p><a href="">Leffel et al. (2016)</a> looked at the processesing of relative and absolute gradable adjectives within varying contexts. They looked at the effect that the presence/absence of a contrast set and the type of adjective (gradable vs. asbolute) had on location of eye-gaze. We replicate their eye-tracking study as an incremental decisions and production task.</p>
