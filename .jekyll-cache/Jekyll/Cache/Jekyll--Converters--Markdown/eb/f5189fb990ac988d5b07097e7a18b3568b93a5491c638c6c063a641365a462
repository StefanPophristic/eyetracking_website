<p>The Linking Hypothesis is a collaborative project that aims to assess and make explicit the link between eye-movements, linguistic input, and cognitive processes in visual world paradigm (VWP) studiesâ€”a method widely used in psycholinguistics.</p>

<p>We believe that the linking hypothesis for such eye-tracking data must account for <strong>exploitation</strong> and <strong>exploration</strong> of the visual scene. That is, <strong>exploiting</strong> visual cues to understand an intended target of an utterance and <strong>exploring</strong> the visual space given unexpected linguistic input.</p>

<h1 id="our-projects">Our Projects</h1>

<p>Our projects are incremental-decision task and free production task replications of various eye-tracking studies. Each is grouped under the name of the original eye-tracking study which it replicates.</p>
